Projects
• Facial Emotion Detection using Deep Learning Dec. 2022
◦ Built a web-app with flask utilizing deep neural networks for expression classification from a facial image or video
◦ Introduced time-continuous dimensional descriptions of emotions (e.g., arousal, valence) to analyze both categorical
and continuous changes in expression and enhance the representation of the full spectrum of emotions
