Projects
• Facial Emotion Detection using Deep Learning Dec. 2022
◦ Built a web-app with flask utilizing deep neural networks for expression classification from a facial image or video
◦ Introduced time-continuous dimensional descriptions of emotions (e.g., arousal, valence) to analyze both categorical
and continuous changes in expression and enhance the representation of the full spectrum of emotions
• One Shot Face Recognition using Deep Learning March. 2021
◦ Constructed a program that captured and detected faces within image or live video
◦ Generate embedding vectors of input and output was given based on these vectors using VGG-32 network
• Mini Desktop Assistant (Personal Project) Dec. 2020
◦ Programmed an assistant application in Python that performs tasks such as playing music and opening apps over
voice command; responses were formulated using text-to-speech feature
◦ Integrated functionality to send/schedule Emails and WhatsApp texts over voice command
• Optical Character Recognition Application using Machine Learning Nov. 2020
◦ Created an application to recognize and extract text within a digital image or scanned document
◦ Converted image to gray-scale and performed morphological operations like erosion and dilation on the image to
emphasize on character edges to better understand text
